**Tweaked to work with Evolve Content**

Steps to work on your local environment:

- Install a local dev server (Mamp, IIS, Apache, etc)
- Create a new folder, and drop in simple-api-evolve.htm
- Unzip your Scorm course into the same folder, and navigate to your browser to your local server to simple-api-evolve.htm to get started
